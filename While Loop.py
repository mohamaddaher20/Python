# First look at While Loops 

# While loop will always run as long as the boolean expression is TRUE. If the boolean expression is FALSE it will stop running. 

# general syntax of While loop:
# While (<boolean exp>):
    # code to repeat


# This code will never stop
# x=1
# while (x < 10):
#     print("Hello")


#It will print four times because 5 is not less than five. 
#x = 1
#while (x < 5):
# print("Hello")
#     x= x + 1
# print("end of program")



# counter + 1 to make a loop end. If you dont included it will never stop. 
# counter = 1
# while (counter <= 5):
#     print("Hello #{0}".format(counter))
#     counter = counter + 1

# print(counter)
# print("end of program")






















# If you want to run the program again after is finished(Paintshop) 
# userchoice = "Y"
# while (userchoice == "Y"):
#     main()
#     userchoice = input("Do you want to enter the dimensions of a room? (Y/N): ")

#                                     # O R 

#     while (input("Do you want to enter the dimensions of a room? (Y/N): ")).upper() == "Y":
#         main()
