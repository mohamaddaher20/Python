#Description: The organizers of the annual Girl Guide cookie sale event want to raise 
# the stakes on the number of cookies sold and are offering cool prizes to those
# guides who go above and beyond in their sales efforts. The organizers want a program
# to print the guide list and their prizes.

# Ask the user how many guides sold cookies in the current event,
# For each numbered guide up to the user-entered count of guides, allow the 
# user to enter a name and the number of boxes of cookies that person sold. 
# Calculate and output a list of all guide names, 
# Display the average sales, and the prize that each guide won,
# The highest selling guide gets a trip to the Girl Guide Jamboree, any guides
# selling above average get a badge, and any guides selling at least one box get to 
# split the remaining cookies, with guides selling no boxes shut out of all prizes 
# (as they should be).
# (Hint: Some potential solution ideas: Research parallel arrays or two-dimensional lists)
