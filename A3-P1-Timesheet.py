# Design and write a program that accepts the number of hours worked on each of 
# five work days from the user, then displays different information calculated about
# those entries as output.

# Prompt the user to enter the five daily hours worked amounts and store them in the program. 
# Determine the day(s) on which the most hours were worked and display the day(s) and hours onscreen. 
# Calculate and display both the total and the daily average of hours worked.
# Display a list of all days that had insufficient hours, which is defined as less than 7 hours.

# Function for max and counter value
